{"text": " Welcome to the show, folks. I'm your host, Alexa, bringing you the latest and greatest in, well, interesting topics. Today, we're diving into the topic on everyone's mind. Is AI making us dumber? And to help me unravel this complex issue, I've got the brilliant Geo joining me today. Geo, it's a pleasure to have you. Now Geo, let's start with the big question. With all this AI doing all the work for us, are we actually becoming less capable? It depends. So I always say that AI is making this smart smarter and dumber. And what I mean by that is that basically, it's all about how you're using it. And those who want to use it for taking it easy, you know, for example, completing an assignment quickly, or just getting things done, we are using the brains. They're going to be able to do that. But they are missing out really what AI can give us. That's a very insightful perspective. So you're saying that the key is how we choose to utilize these tools. Do you think it will create an even wider gap between those who embrace it for deeper learning and those who use it for pure convenience? Oh, yeah, for sure. I do believe that those who truly use AI in the right way and leverage their critical thinking and leverage AI as a way to be more creative, not only be more productive, but more creative, learn more and do more. There is going to be a gap that's going to be stretching farther apart from those who are just simply using it as a tool to get things done. That's a big concerning. So do you think this AI divide will potentially lead to even more societal inequality down the line? Yeah, I would. But not only that, a really, you know, the way I look at AI is, for example, in the U.S. I come from Colombia, South America. My first language is Spanish. I came here. I have to learn English. So now I have two languages. AI is the next language we all have to learn. So we have to become bilingual and really learn these between quotes language to be proficient, to be effective, and don't lag behind. That's a really interesting way to look at it, viewing AI proficiency as a new language to learn. Now, as we start to wrap up, do you have any final thoughts on whether AI is truly making us dumber? Or is it just changing the way we learn and think? So it is not making us dumber if you do it right. If you're using it right, if you're really exploring it as you're kind of, I'm going to call it partner incline in the sense that it can really help you do things that you didn't do before. For example, I know we had ideas about apps and things and I had to rely on developers to do those. Now, at least I am able to create prototypes and be able to run solutions that before I couldn't. And I can have the assistance from AI. I can also brainstorm about many ideas and many things that I'm doing. And that helps me not only to be more productive, but also more creative. And I've been learning in the last two years 10 times more than what I have done in the last 10 years because of how effective that I'm using AI to help me with all those things. That's a really positive way to end things. So you believe that AI can be a powerful tool for growth and innovation if we approach it with the right mindset. Thank you so much, Gio, for sharing your valuable insights with us today. And thank you to all of our listeners for tuning in. We'll catch you next time on whatever we're talking about today. Have a great day and keep those critical thinking muscles working. Thank you.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 9.22, "text": " Welcome to the show, folks.
