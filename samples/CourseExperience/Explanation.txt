So what this showcases is a. Program. Program that they actually found the Co founder the CEO attended for entrepreneurship and. Was able to convert the entire program that. Was done in a hammer mode into a full course. With some improvements in the design. Because this problem did not have any course, everything was shared via Onedrive files and instead. You know, we could really think about how to do things in a very different way. You know how we do this, you know different options. So bottom line is it these highlights our experience and the design. We're designed experience of the learner and we're able to generate a discourse was generated in less than a week and this is for a 7 week modular course with content.
